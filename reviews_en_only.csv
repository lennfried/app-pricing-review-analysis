Nothing new and pay for it than you can't even cancel it seems to be kind of scam app with no benefits at all but pay the subscription charges.

Needed a little boost to refocus. I'm now healthy enough to exercise and I discovered home exercise will be best. (Gym is 40 min away) always an excuse to not exercise. Quick home routines are abundant in this program. Exactly what I need. Too busy to drive to the gym. Too busy to set aside even an hour for physical exercise. But 20 min here & there when I can is plausible. Can't wait for the transformation 😍. I like the approach and all the resources available to me.,5,0,7.0.1,2022-07-25 20:27:07,"Christina, we are so impressed! You rock 😍️. We'd love to hear more about your experience.

You must enter your recipes into MyNetDiary so it can calculate nutrition, which is expected, but maintaining your recipes is absolutely frustrating. Recipes can't be updated once you've used them (ingredients, amounts, etc.). You must make a copy of the original recipe / make the changes you need / save the new copy / retire the old recipe / and finally rename the new one with the old name. MyNetDiary is pretty good at importing recipes, but you still have to use a separate recipe app to maintain your recipes. You make your changes in the separate app / copy your updated recipes to MyNetDiary under a new name / and then proceed as outlined above. Having to duplicate recipes in a more capable recipe app and then continually transferring them back to MyNetDiary is starting to become a deal breaker. I would love for this app to manage recipes better. Also, there is no formatting capability in the recipe notes field for simple things like bullets, headings, etc (eg. TinyMCE). This app deserves 5 stars; these devs are smart guys and should be able to figure this out. If these problems get resolved I will come back and update this review.",3,0,7.9.2,2022-04-18 20:08:53,"Hello Steve, thank you very much for you thorough review.

Logging what I eat has been the only thing that has worked for me in the past to lose weight. (To be honest, it wasn't lost - just on vacation.) Once again I'm giving it a shot. One issue I've had with other trackers is poorly maintained food databases. I've found some issues with Cronometer's data differing from the item's ""Nutrition Facts""(NF) too. BUT, the other trackers I used let anyone enter data resulting in many, many duplicate and erroneous entries. Cronometer lets you report the issue and send them a photo of the current package's NF. I did this with a couple of items yesterday evening. This morning I received emails saying that they have reviewed and updated their database. Blew my socks off!! Their responsiveness drove me to purchase a subscription. I love the integration of the app with my Fitbit. My scale integrates with my Fitbit, and Cronometer gets the weight from Fitbit.

Also the arrows to change between dates would be nice on each side of the date. Instead of both on the left side.

The dev has said that all the 'Common Foods' are free and all other foods need a monthly subscription. Fair enough!

From the reports tab you can choose to set goals (the target icon) for various nutrients and use that to assess how you're tracking. We should of course provide more insight and guidance as you suggest.

I wanted to figure out where my daily calories are coming from, but this app, like all food trackers, suffers from one tedious issue - having to figure out portion sizes when making home cooked meals. Making one pot meals for 10-12 servings with lots of ingredients is hard to track. And the issue with this app is calories per serving/ounce/Tbsp/etc... are often wrong. I could scan barcodes and they rarely matched what it said on the package. Good for a week, but uninstalled.",3,4,,2022-05-16 03:49:45,"Thank you very much for your feedback!

Worked great for two days. Then I suddenly ended up on a generic screen that had some of my personal info but the name field was blank. Could not move past this screen without deleting it which then took me to the login screen where I'm apparently now locked out. Asked for a password reset several times, contacted developer thru email 2 days ago with no response.They just took me $19.99. Have requested a refund from Google pay.
